# React Hangman

This is just a small project that I made it a thousand hours ago (maybe) and this is my first small project. So, it may be a bit buggy and unusable. I'm lazy to do responsive for it.

This project has been uploaded from local storage to GitHub to deploy it for future usage.

# How to use?

Same as a run-of-the-mill procedure:
1. Clone it
2. nodejs install
3. npm run dev / yarn run dev

(if you don't know how to do, check it on Google)
